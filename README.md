## Countdown Timer with Message Python Challenge

Description:

Ask the user to enter a starting number (e.g., 10).

Count down to 1 using a for or while loop, printing each number with a 1-second delay between prints.

After the countdown, display a final message like "Timeâ€™s up!" or "Go!".

ðŸ’¡ Bonus:

Add a check to ensure the user enters a positive integer.

Let the user choose the final message before the countdown begins.
